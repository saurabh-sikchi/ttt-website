I am a girl/group of group of girls joining. What measures will be in place for our safety?
Your safety is our priority. We foster a culture a culture of safety and comfort, where everyone can be their authentic open self. If anyone in the group harasses or engages in behavior that makes you uncomfortable, they’ll be excluded from all further activities, and Tipsy Turtle will only support their stay—nothing more
