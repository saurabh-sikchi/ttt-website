    <p class="mb-2 text-gray-600">We are just a little more expensive than others! And that's on purpose. It matters to us a lot who we travel with.</p>
    <p class="mb-2 text-gray-600">We want you to hang out with cool people, share vibes, and walk out with memories and friendships of a lifetime. Maybe you even share a hotel room with a travel buddy for a few days.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-600 font-semibold">Do you really want to be spending this precious time with the cheapest-item-on-the-menu-chasers? Or would you rather enjoy your time with a more sophisticated crowd? Think of it like networking in the first class lounge of the airport.</p>
